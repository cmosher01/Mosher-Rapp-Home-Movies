18 fps -> NTSC  IVTC patterns

matching using BOTTOM field as basis against TOP fields from:
  P = previous frame,
  C = current frame,
  N = next frame,
  lower case p, c, n, indicate partial match, due to double exposed field(s)
  a/b indicates either a or b match the same

   1        c   P   C   p   P
  16        C   P   C   p   P
  17        C   P   C   c   P
  32        C   p   P/C c   P
   1        C   p   P/C

with just two exceptions, due to film and NTSC being in sync here:
  first field (frame 0000): C   instead of c
  last  field (frame 4999): P/C instead of P
