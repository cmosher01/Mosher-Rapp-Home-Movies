PART I OF 2 PART QUOTE:

Re:Film-to-Video.com: Your 6/8/2005 Quote: Thanks!

Hi Christopher,

Congratulations. Having read my website - Film-to-Video.com -
you are now an educated consumer and now know the value of having
true Digital Masters. You also know the games that the "transfer mills" play.

A long time ago, I made the decision that I would rather apologize
once for higher prices, than apologize many times for lower quality.
That being the case, you quote follows:

YOUR FILM - Based on having the following breakdown of reels and footage:

0.0 X 800 ft Reel
0.0 X 400 ft Reel (6&7inch)
0.0 X 350 ft Reel
0.0 X 300 ft Reel
0.0 X 250 ft Reel
0.0 X 200 ft Reel (5 inch)
0.0 X 150 ft Reel
0.0 X 100 ft Reel
25.0    X 50 ft (25' dble) reels 3 inch
25.0    Total Reels

You have just under 1.39 hour(s) of finished video.

Projects longer than 3 hours will be produced in 2 hour segments
and shipped to you; you will then make payments only on
only what you have been previewed in DVD. Most people  like
receiving 2 hours each month, and 1 payment each month
 until the project is finished.

YOUR PRICING OPTIONS:
$438 Option #1: Express -- Full delivery within Agreed Express period "to be agreed upon" (No
Discounts)
$330 Option #2: Partial Express -- Partial Delivery Agreed Express period (usually 2 - 4 weeks)
$350 Option #3: Flexible Delivery Date 20% off of Option #1 as advertised
$300 Total: for with $50 off for Early Bird shipping Option #3 only.
(See PRICING DETAILS, below)
DEPOSIT: $150 on options #3 only; Option #1 & #2is 50% of total price.

We charge only our cost for extra  DVD copy sets, up to 6 complete sets.
Transfer mills might "optionally" offer 1 MiniDV "pseudo master"; but,
we give you 2 MiniDV Master sets -
one set  is your "virgin digital master";
one set is your "virgin digital master backup".
Transfer mills usually give you
NO digital backup of their so called "master"; and,
NO free shipping - say nothing of 3 phases of shipping; and,
NO "at home" preview of your actual DVD product; and,
NO final payment after you have see their work; and
NO "100% money back guarantee".
We do ALL the above.

YOUR SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS:
Special: Includes 6 DVDs, 1 MiniDV BK

BONUS: You get the DVD sets FREE -- IF AND only IF -- your project is
post-marked 5 business days after the date of this quote. This quote
also includes free music.  If you don't want music, just request "no
 music" on the face of the quote.

NOTE: If you can not get things ready in 5 business days, please call us,
so that we can make scheduling arrangements and extend your discounts
to a discount deadline that you can meet. Call us at 505-820-1331.

Carl, our Studio Manager, or I would love to meet you by phone,
talk with you, and answer any questions you may have, too.

WHAT YOU RECEIVE:
8 "sets" of your video on mixed media as follows:
2 Digital Master Sets -- high resolution, full frame full resolution
Digital Video MiniDV digital tapes ( i.e., 1 Master & 1 Backup).
5 Set(s) DVD's in MPEG-2 format made directly from your masters
1 Set(s) DVD as a "confirmation video" set.

Each "set" is made up of up to 2 video volume(s). Each volume within
a set will be about 60 minutes; unless, we combine the
last 2 volumes onto one 83 minute volume -- to keep you from
having a very "short volume".

By special request only: (0 means you do NOT get this)
0 Set(s) high resolution Digital 8 (D8) master tape set(s)

NOTE: We do NOT send MiniDV or Digital 8 Master/Backup sets for
confirmation - UNLESS we are Paid in Full -- in advance.

For a DEFINITION OF EACH MEDIA SET please see our website at
http://www.film-to-video.com/media.html

MORE QUESTIONS?: Please Call me or refer back to my website.

TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENT:

BY ACCEPTING THIS QUOTE, YOU AGREE that if we can not
give you a product or delivery up to our standards -
for any reason - then, at our option, we will either cure the product
or delivery problem or give you your deposit back.
For a complete list of what we guarantee -- and don't -
please see my website.

YOUR "SAFE SHIPPING" STRATEGY:
PHASE #1: We mail one or more finished DVD Confirmation
Copies. NOTE: I guarantee my work. Any problems are worked out in
this phase.
PHASE #2: We ship your remaining DVD copy sets and DV master
backup and your original film.
PHASE #3: Finally, we mail your digital master set.
All shipping is included in the price of this quote.
Transfer mills don't do this.

NOTE: To protect you, we NEVER ship your "film" and digital master
 sets together nor ship your digital master set and digital master
backup sets together - unless prearranged with you.
Transfer mills don't protect you this way.

DEPOSIT AND PAYMENTS:
On a project of this size, I can accept a deposit to be accepted as
your down-payment of $150 by personal check (see additional
discount below).

PAYOFF:
ONLY after you receive your "confirmation videos" you agree to
either (on small projects) make payment in full, or (on larger
projects) stay "paid up" in  $300 increments until the balance above
 is Paid in Full.

CHECKS:
I will hold your check until I actually start your project.

VISA /MASTERCARD:
I only accept VISA / MC. Because VISA/MC charge me for YOU to use
your creditcard, I need to pass it on to you -- as you are getting the loan -
 not me.

To compute the 3% add-on, multiply 1.03 times the Grand Total
(from the Pricing Option you choose above).  Then fill in the credit
card work sheet at the bottom of this quote and sign it.
I will run your transaction at the time I start your project for the
amount of the down payment. Then, depending on the size of
your project, I will run multiple transactions until you are Paid-in-Full.
Each installment will have the 3% figured into the amount.

VOLUME DISCOUNTS:
If you have other FAMILY OR FRIENDS who also have film-to-video
projects, I will "combine" the total number of reels to compute a
VOLUME DISCOUNT - for you and for them -- only if they ship their
projects within one month from now.

Please call me so I can 1) ask you questions to fine tune your quote,
 2) answer your questions, and 3) review shipping procedures -
before shipping.

I will send your Packing & Shipping Information next. Do NOT try to ship
unless you have this information sheet. Call me if you do not have it now.

SHIPPING & ORGANIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:

ORGANIZING AND NUMBERING YOUR FILM:
YOU are responsible to organize and re-number your film.  If we do it or re-do it, you may not
like it (see our terms of agreement).
1) Do NOT mix 8mm gauge film with Super 8 gauge film. We will reorganize them if you do. Regular
8mm reels first; Super 8 reels last.
2) Group your reels first in stacks by year; and then organize each stack by month or event. You
can find "dates" on inside of flaps on boxes, postmarks, writing on the leaders on the film itself.
3) Number your film and put a circle around each number - this helps us a lot.
4) Put you name on large reels.

SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS:
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS "TO THE "T" - I know this is "over kill"; but we have NEVER lost a
shipment.

PRE-SHIPPING PREPARATION:
Put your film in a tuff plastic bag and put a full copy of THIS quote in the plastic bag, TOO!

YOUR PERSONAL CHECK:
PLEASE write "FOR DEPOSIT ONLY" on the back of your check and
make them payable to "Bruce Mayfield, d.b.a. Film-to-Video" AND
put YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS on the face of the check.
Then clip your check to your quote and send it with your project.

 WRAPPING YOUR PACKAGE:
DO NOT "wrap" your box in paper. Ugly boxes are OK! Use wide tape.
Use the 3 Layer Wrapping Method:
Layer #1: Using wide tape, seal ALL your seams first.
Layer #2: Then "cross wrap" your seams -- taping completely around the entire box -- far left,
center, and far right.
Layer #3: Then "criss-cross" Layer #2 with -- taping completely around the entire box -- far left,
center, and far right. Will look like a net around the box.

EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION:
1) On one panel of your box, in big letters, put the words, "EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION ".
2) Then put YOUR name, address, phone number, and email and my (see below) name, address, and
email AND "Film-to-Video.com" Also put my Toll Free Number: 877-650-0901 with the words  "Toll Free"
on the box. This a special number for shipping emergencies only. Also list our direct number
505-820-1331.
3) Then on a separate panel put your UPS label.  Ask the shipper NOT to cross out the "Emergency
Contact Information" because you want the extra information on the box.

SHIPPER (CARRIER) INFORMATION:
1) For your information, we have a much better working relationship with UPS than other carriers.
Please ship using UPS 3rd Day Express or equivalent -using "SIGNATURE REQUIRED" upon delivery.
2) Absolutely Do NOT ship your film using US Mail UNLESS you CALL ME for special instructions. We
have had close calls with US Mail.
3) Finally, CALL the day your package arrives, after you see that we have signed for it, to
confirm that you package has been received and logged by US. After 2 PM MST is best.
