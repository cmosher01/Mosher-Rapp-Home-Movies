Forever on DVD:

Please find enclosed approximately 1250 feet of Super 8mm film (on 3 reels), and a 120GB WesternDigital external (USB2) hard drive (S/N WCALK1352706).

As discussed with Shawn Kimmel in email correspondence, please digitize with the following provisions:

FULL FRAME—NO CROPPING
Please capture each film frame in total. Include a couple of lines of the previous and next frames at the top and bottom. With the resulting aspect ratio of 720:486, this should allow for capturing the full width of the original film frame, plus some unexposed film edges at the left and right, and it should include (part of) the sprocket hole. Do not crop or mask anything.

8-BIT 4:2:2 UNCOMPRESSED

NO TELECINE OR PULLDOWN
Please do not apply any telecine or pulldown. I would like to receive each original progressive frame (only). No interlacing or duplication of frames. Note that the original is 18 frames per second, and the resulting file need not play back at the correct speed.

EMAIL 2 SECONDS (MOV and AVI)
Before final processing of the full file, please email to cmosher01@yahoo.com about 2 seconds of the digitized film so I can verify the format. Please try 1 in MOV format, and 1 in AVI format. After evaluating the two alternatives, I’ll email back which one I want.

Thank you very much for your service, and please contact me if you have any questions.



Sincerely,



Chris Mosher
